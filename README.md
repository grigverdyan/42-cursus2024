## üó£Ô∏è About 42

  Thanks to its innovative teaching methods, 42 is able to offer training par excellence without resorting to lectures.
  The pedagogical staff is available to help the students find their own solutions. In order to progress at 42, you have
  to work in groups, lean with the community to overcome challenges and then, share your experience with your peers. You
  don‚Äôt learn programming by copying algorithms on paper!
  
	42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology:
	no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer
	learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is
	free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming
	thus "cadets" (42's students).

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.

## üåå 42's galaxy (curriculum)

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.
